## 1. Background and Overview

### Business Context

This project analyzes a **synthetic e-commerce dataset** created for educational and portfolio purposes, representing a UK-based online retailer specializing in **clothing and jewelry**. The company is entirely fictional, and the dataset does not aim to perfectly replicate real-world market conditions.

While the data was generated to resemble common e-commerce structures (transactions, customers, products, time-based variables), certain distributions and patterns may appear simplified or idealized. This is intentional: the primary focus of the project is not realism at the market level, but rather the **end-to-end analytics process**, including data cleaning, querying, and insight generation.

Over the course of **one year**, the dataset contains approximately **50,000 transactions**, generating **£4.89 million in total revenue**. These figures provide sufficient scale and complexity to simulate a **mid-sized e-commerce scenario** for analytical practice.

The dataset enables structured exploration of how products, customers, and time-based factors can be analyzed to extract business insights within an e-commerce context.

### Analytical Objectives

From a **data analytics perspective**, the primary objective of this project is to support **data-driven decision-making** by identifying actionable patterns that can improve business performance. Specifically, the analysis aims to:

* Identify **high-value products** based on sales volume, revenue contribution, and customer ratings.
* Understand **customer behavior patterns**, including purchasing frequency and value generation.
* Detect **temporal trends** (day, hour, seasonality) that concentrate sales and revenue.
* Provide insights to **optimize product offering, operations, and customer experience**.

These insights are framed to reflect the type of questions a real e-commerce business would ask to improve profitability and efficiency.

### Technical Approach

For readers interested in the technical implementation, the project follows a structured analytics workflow:

* **Data Cleaning & Exploration**: Performed using Python to inspect data quality, handle inconsistencies, and prepare the dataset for analysis.
